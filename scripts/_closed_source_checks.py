"""Shared assertions for the closed-source no-leaked-source invariant.

Used by both verify_closed_source_wheel.py (checks a built wheel's zip
contents, any platform, run manually/locally) and
check_installed_no_leaked_source.py (checks an already-installed package's
files; cibuildwheel's test-command has no access to the wheel path itself,
only to what got installed, so it needs a filesystem-based variant of the
same check).

Mirrors the cobol-parser sibling repo's scripts/_closed_source_checks.py.
